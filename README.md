# angela-js-push
practicing both angela's initial js exercises again and getting used to git.

going to use the ssh key method again to do this not the https. on my laptop i dont ever remember putting in my github password.  i did set up my email though. can't remember if i was able to push things to my account without the email.

need to figure out how to remove my info that may have me linked to github so i can see how this is really working.  i believe everything is in the .ssh key.  i used to command line to put my email in i also remember that.
